 Brief Documentation
---------------------

**Try Python** should be easy to use, but here are some brief notes on its features. If you do have any problems, or
find any bugs, *please* use the ``Report a Bug`` link to let me know. You can also use the issue tracker on the
Google Code project page for feature requests and bug reports.

The online interpreter has the following features:

    * Auto-resizes with the browser
    * Navigation bar through the tutorial pages at the top and bottom
    * Individual pages are bookmarkable and the URL fragment auto-updates as you change page
    * Mouse scroll wheel supported over the tutorial and console scroll viewers
    * Control-C interrupts the running code with a keyboard interrupt
    * ``raw_input`` and ``input`` functions work in the interpreter
    * Basic auto-indent and auto-dedent in the console
    * Console history, including multiline history
    * ``reset`` command to clear the console 

Not much of the Python standard library is included. I intend to expand the tutorial adding new modules as they are needed (the whole standard library is about 5mb and would make Try Python take much longer to load).

Some of the console history code was contributed by Resolver Systems.

This is an interactive Python tutorial created for Silverlight by Michael Foord.

This tutorial is based on the Python tutorial that is part of the Python documentation

By the way, the language is named after the BBC show "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and has nothing to do with nasty reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!

This tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples, beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.

In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (``>>>`` and ``...``): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.

Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.

Some examples:

.. code-block:: python

    # this is the first comment
    SPAM = 1                 # and this is the second comment
                             # ... and now a third!
    STRING = "# This is not a comment."

========================


Python is a popular open source, high level, object oriented, interpreted,
dynamic programming language. Python was first released in 1991, preceding
popular languages like Java. The Python philosophy emphasizes clean and
readable code. It supports many programming styles including procedural,
functional and object orientated. These features, combined with a large
and powerful standard library, make it an excellent first language for
beginners *and* a great general purpose programming language for experienced developers.

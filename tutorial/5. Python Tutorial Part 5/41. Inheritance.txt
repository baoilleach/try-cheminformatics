=============
 Inheritance
=============

Of course, a language feature would not be worthy of the name “class” without supporting inheritance. The syntax for a derived class definition looks like this::

    class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
        <statement-1>
        .
        .
        .
        <statement-N>

The name ``BaseClassName`` must be defined in a scope containing the derived class definition. In place of a base class name, other arbitrary expressions are also allowed. This can be useful, for example, when the base class is defined in another module:

.. code-block:: python

    class DerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):

Execution of a derived class definition proceeds the same as for a base class. When the class object is constructed, the base class is remembered. This is used for resolving attribute references: if a requested attribute is not found in the class, the search proceeds to look in the base class. This rule is applied recursively if the base class itself is derived from some other class.

There’s nothing special about instantiation of derived classes: ``DerivedClassName()`` creates a new instance of the class. Method references are resolved as follows: the corresponding class attribute is searched, descending down the chain of base classes if necessary, and the method reference is valid if this yields a function object.

Derived classes may override methods of their base classes. Because methods have no special privileges when calling other methods of the same object, a method of a base class that calls another method defined in the same base class may end up calling a method of a derived class that overrides it. (For C++ programmers: all methods in Python are effectively virtual.)

An overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to extend rather than simply replace the base class method of the same name. There is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just call ``BaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments)``. This is occasionally useful to clients as well. (Note that this only works if the base class is defined or imported directly in the global scope.)

Python has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:

    * Use ``isinstance()`` to check an object’s type: ``isinstance(obj, int)`` will be ``True`` only if ``obj.__class__`` is ``int`` or some class derived from ``int``.
    * Use ``issubclass()`` to check class inheritance: ``issubclass(bool, int)`` is ``True`` since ``bool`` is a subclass of ``int``. However, ``issubclass(int, float)`` is ``False`` since ``int`` is not a subclass of ``float``.


Multiple Inheritance
====================

Python supports a limited form of multiple inheritance as well. A class definition with multiple base classes looks like this::

    class DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):
        <statement-1>
        .
        .
        .
        <statement-N>

For old-style classes, the only rule is depth-first, left-to-right. Thus, if an attribute is not found in ``DerivedClassName``, it is searched in ``Base1``, then (recursively) in the base classes of ``Base1`, and only if it is not found there, it is searched in ``Base2``, and so on.

(To some people breadth first — searching ``Base2`` and ``Base3`` before the base classes of ``Base1`` — looks more natural. However, this would require you to know whether a particular attribute of ``Base1`` is actually defined in ``Base1`` or in one of its base classes before you can figure out the consequences of a name conflict with an attribute of ``Base2``. The depth-first rule makes no differences between direct and inherited attributes of ``Base1``.)

For *new-style classes*, the method resolution order changes dynamically to support cooperative calls to ``super()``. This approach is known in some other multiple-inheritance languages as call-next-method and is more powerful than the super call found in single-inheritance languages.

With new-style classes, dynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more diamond relationships (where one at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the bottommost class). For example, all new-style classes inherit from ``object``, so any case of multiple inheritance provides more than one path to reach ``object``. To keep the base classes from being accessed more than once, the dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-right ordering specified in each class, that calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that a class can be subclassed without affecting the precedence order of its parents). Taken together, these properties make it possible to design reliable and extensible classes with multiple inheritance. For more detail, see http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/.

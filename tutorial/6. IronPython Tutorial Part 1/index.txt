 IronPython Tutorial Part 1
============================

IronPython aims to be a fully compatible implementation of the Python language.
At the same time, the value of a separate implementation than CPython is 
to make available the .NET ecosystem of libraries. IronPython does this by
exposing .NET concepts as Python entities. Existing Python syntax and new
Python libraries (like ``clr``) are used to make .NET features available
to IronPython code.

This tutorial is from the ``dotnet-integration.rst`` tutorial that comes with
IronPython.

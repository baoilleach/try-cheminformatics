if statements
=============

Besides the ``while`` statement just introduced, Python knows the usual control flow statements known from other languages, with some twists.

Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the ``if`` statement. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> x = int(raw_input("Please enter an integer: "))
    Please enter an integer: 42
    >>> if x < 0:
    ...      x = 0
    ...      print 'Negative changed to zero'
    ... elif x == 0:
    ...      print 'Zero'
    ... elif x == 1:
    ...      print 'Single'
    ... else:
    ...      print 'More'
    ...
    More

NOTE: The ``raw_input`` function does not work (yet) in the *Try Python* interpreter.

There can be zero or more ``elif`` parts, and the ``else`` part is optional. The keyword '``elif``' is short for 'else if', and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An ``if`` ... ``elif`` ... ``elif`` ... sequence is a substitute for the ``switch`` or ``case`` statements found in other languages.

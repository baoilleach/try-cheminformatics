**Try Python** is an interactive Python tutorial created for Silverlight and
Moonlight by Michael Foord.

The Python console to the right behaves like the Python interactive interpreter.
It runs IronPython 2.6.1, which is the equivalent of Python 2.6. The code you 
enter in the console runs in the browser.

Choose a section of the tutorial to start on from this page, or use the
navigation bar at the top.

Most of the tutorial pages have code examples for you to try out. The examples
have a ':raw-xaml:`<Run FontWeight="Bold" FontFamily="Consolas, Monaco, Lucida Console, Global Monospace" FontSize="15" Foreground="#000080">&#160;>>>&#160;</Run>`'
button that copies them to the console. Try it out with the traditional Python
*Hello World*:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> print 'Hello world!'

Here's a slightly longer version for those who prefer object oriented programming:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> class HelloWorld(object):
    ...     def say_hello(self):
    ...         print 'Hello world!'
    ... 
    >>> hello = HelloWorld()
    >>> hello.say_hello()
    Hello world!

If you want an explanation of how the code above works, then you need to read
the tutorial...

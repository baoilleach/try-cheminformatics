Welcome to the Interactive Cheminformatics Tutorial. This tutorial was developed by Noel O'Boyle using the **Try Python** software created by Michael Foord. Please send any suggestions for improvements to baoilleach@gmail.com.

Instructions
============

The Python console to the right behaves like the Python interactive interpreter. It runs IronPython 2.0, which is the equivalent of Python 2.5. The code you enter in the console runs in the browser.

Most of the tutorial pages have code examples for you to try out. The examples have a ':raw-xaml:`<Run FontWeight="Bold" FontFamily="Consolas, Monaco, Lucida Console, Global Monospace" FontSize="15" Foreground="#000080">&#160;>>>&#160;</Run>`' button that copies them to the console. Try it out with the traditional Python *Hello World*:

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> print 'Hello Chemistry World!'
